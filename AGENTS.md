## Memory System

This project uses a layered memory architecture. Read files in this order:

| Priority | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| 🔴 Must | `.agents/memory/system.md` | Tech stack, constraints, naming conventions |
| 🔴 Must | `.agents/memory/project.md` | Current state, feature inventory, known gotchas |
| 🟡 Before coding | `.agents/memory/decisions.md` | ADRs — architectural decisions you must not violate |
| 🟡 Before coding | `.agents/rules/coding-standards.md` | Code style, patterns, forbidden practices |
| 🟢 Context | `.agents/memory/log.md` | Session history — what happened recently |
| 🟢 Context | `.agents/memory/graph.md` | Module dependencies, table relationships |
| 🔵 Reference | `.agents/external/sources.md` | External docs, library links |
| 🔵 Reference | `.agents/rules/commit-convention.md` | Commit message format |
| 🔵 Reference | `.agents/rules/review-checklist.md` | Pre-merge verification |

## Critical Rules (Quick Reference)

1. **No SSR** — Vite SPA only. No `loader`, no `getServerSideProps`, no `createServerFn`.
2. **decimal.js for money** — NEVER use JS `+ - * /` for financial calculations.
3. **Append-only transactions** — `payment_transactions` has no UPDATE/DELETE. Use reversals.
4. **Multi-tenancy** — Every table MUST have `school_id`. RLS enforced at DB level.
5. **Activity logs** — Use `withActivityLog` middleware, not manual inserts.
6. **Better Auth** — NOT Clerk. Auth provider is Better Auth. See decisions.md C7.
7. **TypeScript strict** — No `any`. Explicit return types on exports.

## Tech Stack (Summary)

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, TanStack Start (SPA), TanStack Router/Query, Zustand |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui |
| API | oRPC |
| Auth | Better Auth (identity/session) + EDARA RBAC (`user_school_assignments`) |
| Database | Neon PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, pg-boss |
| Financial | decimal.js (mandatory) |

## Dev Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm typecheck    # TypeScript check
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm format:check # Prettier check
pnpm test         # Vitest (watch mode)
pnpm test:run     # Vitest (once)
pnpm db:generate  # Drizzle: generate migrations
pnpm db:push      # Drizzle: push schema to DB
```

## CI Pipeline

Run in order: `format:check` → `typecheck` → `lint --max-warnings 10` → `build`

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Phase 1 — Migration from Mock to Real Backend
- **Progress:** Sections 1–7 are complete through Step 19, and Section 8 Step 20 is complete (teacher backend API is live; teacher frontend is still mock-backed)
- **Next:** Continue Section 8 with Step 21 — wire Teacher Management frontend to the live API, while keeping AI memory files aligned with the real codebase state

## Git Workflow

This project enforces a strict branching discipline. Understanding it is mandatory before making any commits or pull requests.

### Branch Hierarchy

We maintain two long-lived branches: `main` and `dev`. All feature work happens on short-lived **local** branches created from `dev`. Feature branches are never pushed to the remote — they are merged locally into `dev`, then `dev` is pushed and a PR is opened directly to `main`.

- **`main`** is the production branch. It receives code only through pull requests, and those PRs are always **squash-merged**. This keeps `main`'s history clean: one commit per meaningful body of work.
- **`dev`** is the integration branch. Feature branches merge here locally first. `dev` accumulates granular commits — that's expected and fine.
- **Feature branches** (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`) are created from `dev`, worked on locally, and merged back into `dev` locally. They are never pushed to the remote. There is only one PR per feature: `dev` → `main`.

### Daily Workflow

```bash
git checkout dev && git pull origin dev     # Start from current dev
git checkout -b feat/thing                  # Create local feature branch
# ... work, commit ...
git checkout dev && git merge feat/thing    # Merge locally into dev
git push origin dev                         # Push dev to remote
gh pr create --base main --head dev         # One PR: dev → main
git branch -d feat/thing                    # Delete local branch
```

### The Non-Negotiable Rule

**Every time `dev` is squash-merged into `main`, you must sync `dev` back to `main` immediately.** Squash merging creates a new commit on `main` with a different SHA than anything on `dev`. If you don't sync, the next PR from `dev` to `main` will show phantom diffs — old commits appearing as new changes, even though the content is identical.

There are two sync methods:

1. **Reset (clean):** `git checkout dev && git reset --hard main && git push origin dev --force-with-lease` — makes `dev` identical to `main`. Requires force push.
2. **Merge (safe):** `git checkout dev && git merge main -m "chore: sync dev with main" && git push origin dev` — creates a merge commit but doesn't require force push.

After syncing, verify with `git diff --stat main dev` — it should produce no output.

### Direct Pushes to Main Are Forbidden

All changes to `main` must arrive through a pull request. No exceptions. This applies to both human contributors and AI agents.

## After Your Session

1. Update `.agents/memory/log.md` — append a new session entry at the top
2. Update `.agents/memory/project.md` — if feature status changed
3. Record new ADRs in `.agents/memory/decisions.md` — if architectural decisions were made
4. Follow commit convention in `.agents/rules/commit-convention.md`

## Environment Notes

- **OS:** Windows (use PowerShell, not UNIX commands)
- **Package manager:** pnpm only
- **Quirks:** rollup 4.60.0 override, 8 ESLint warnings baseline, 581KB chunk warning
