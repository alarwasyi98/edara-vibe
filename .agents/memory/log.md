## Session 17 — 2026-04-30: Step 9 — Auth API Route (Blockers Log)

**Branch:** `backup/step0-plan-update`
**Commit:** (pending — changes staged, not yet committed)

### What Happened
Implemented Step 9 (Auth API Route Handler) and encountered multiple blockers that required debugging and resolution before the route could function.

### Blockers Encountered

#### Blocker 1: `createAPIFileRoute` Does Not Exist in SPA Mode
- **Problem:** Oracle agent recommended using `createAPIFileRoute('/api/auth/$')` for the auth catch-all handler, which is the documented pattern for TanStack Start API routes. However, this export does not exist in `@tanstack/react-start@1.167.50` when running in SPA mode.
- **Root Cause:** TanStack Start SPA mode (`spa: { enabled: true }`) does not expose `createAPIFileRoute` — it only provides `createFileRoute` with `server.handlers` as the escape hatch for API routes.
- **Resolution:** Used `createFileRoute('/api/auth/$')` with `server.handlers` property instead. This is the pattern used by t3-turbo and Better Auth CLI scaffolding.

#### Blocker 2: `window is not defined` — SSR Module Evaluation
- **Problem:** After creating the auth route, the dev server crashed with `ReferenceError: window is not defined` in `auth-client.ts`.
- **Root Cause:** `auth-client.ts` used `window.location.origin` at module-level scope to set `baseURL`. TanStack Start evaluates ALL route modules on the server side (even in SPA mode) to build the route tree. This means any module imported by a route file gets executed in a Node.js context where `window` does not exist.
- **Resolution:** Added a guard: `typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.origin : 'http://localhost:3000'` as the `baseURL` fallback.

#### Blocker 3: `matchMedia is not a function` — Theme Provider SSR Crash
- **Problem:** After fixing the window guard, the server crashed again with `TypeError: matchMedia is not a function` in `theme-provider.tsx`.
- **Root Cause:** Same SSR module evaluation issue. `theme-provider.tsx` called `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` at module level to determine the default theme.
- **Resolution:** Added SSR guard: `typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.matchMedia === 'function'` before calling `matchMedia`.

#### Blocker 4: TanStack Version Mismatch — `router.stores.matches.get()` Crash
- **Problem:** After fixing SSR guards, the main page (`/`) returned HTTP 500 with error: `TypeError: router.stores.matches.get is not a function` at `ssr-server.js:142`.
- **Root Cause:** `package.json` used caret ranges (`^1.x.x`) for TanStack packages, causing `pnpm` to resolve two different versions of `@tanstack/router-core`: v1.168.3 (from `react-router`) and v1.168.17 (from `react-start`). The `ssr-server.js` module expected the `.stores.matches.get()` API from v1.168.15+, but the router instance was created with v1.168.3 which uses a different internal API.
- **Resolution:** Pinned ALL TanStack packages to exact versions (no caret):
  - `@tanstack/react-router`: `1.168.25`
  - `@tanstack/react-start`: `1.167.50`
  - `@tanstack/router-devtools`: `1.166.13`
  - Removed redundant devDeps: `@tanstack/router-plugin`, `@tanstack/start-client-core`, `@tanstack/start-server-core`
  - After `pnpm install`, all packages resolve to single `router-core@1.168.17`

#### Blocker 5: `QueryClientProvider` Duplication
- **Problem:** `__root.tsx` wrapped children in `QueryClientProvider`, but `router.tsx` also wrapped via `Wrap` option — causing React context duplication warnings.
- **Resolution:** Removed `QueryClientProvider` from `__root.tsx`, kept it only in `router.tsx`'s `Wrap` option (single source of truth).

#### Blocker 6: Dev Server Process Management
- **Problem:** After fixing all code issues, could not verify the fix because `curl` returned HTTP 000 (connection refused). Vite reported "ready" but port 3000 was not listening.
- **Root Cause:** The bash tool kills processes after timeout. `pnpm dev` was started with a 20s timeout, Vite reported ready within that window, but the process was killed when the timeout expired. PowerShell `Start-Job` also failed because background jobs run in isolated process spaces that don't bind ports to the host.
- **Resolution:** Used `[System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start()` to spawn a truly detached `cmd.exe /c pnpm dev` process. Vite bound to `[::1]:3000` (IPv6 localhost). Curl needed `http://[::1]:3000/` to connect.

### Files Changed
- `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` — NEW: Better Auth catch-all handler using `createFileRoute` + `server.handlers`
- `src/lib/auth-client.ts` — SSR guard for `window.location.origin`
- `src/context/theme-provider.tsx` — SSR guard for `window.matchMedia`
- `src/router.tsx` — Added `dehydrate`/`hydrate`/`Wrap` with QueryClientProvider
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` — Removed duplicate QueryClientProvider
- `package.json` — Pinned TanStack versions, removed redundant devDeps
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` — Regenerated with pinned versions
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — Regenerated to include `/api/auth/$` route

### Verification
- `/api/auth/ok` → `{"ok":true}` HTTP 200 ✅
- `/` → Full HTML document HTTP 200 (4619 bytes) ✅
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- `vite dev` → starts on port 3000 ✅

### Key Takeaway
TanStack Start SPA mode is NOT a pure client-side SPA — it still evaluates route modules on the server to build the route tree and handle API routes via Nitro. Any module-level code that references browser APIs (`window`, `document`, `matchMedia`) will crash the server. All browser API usage must be guarded with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks or deferred to `useEffect`/runtime.

Executed all 6 sub-tasks of Step 8 (Better Auth Server Setup):

| Sub-task | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 8.1 | Move `src/lib/auth.ts` → `src/server/auth/index.ts` + update imports | ✅ |

- `src/features/users/data/data.ts` — Role labels/values aligned with DB enum
- `.env` — Cleaned: removed Clerk vars, added Better Auth vars
- `.env.local` — Same cleanup

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- `vite dev` → localhost:3000 ready in ~4s ✅
- `grep` for old role names → 0 matches ✅

## Session 15 — 2026-04-29: Step 0 — TanStack Start SPA Migration

**Branch:** `backup/step0-plan-update`
**Commits:** `c6bb610` (docs) → `2247d7b` (feat)

### What Happened
Identified that the implementation plan was missing a critical prerequisite: migrating from plain Vite SPA to TanStack Start SPA mode. Steps 9 (auth API route) and 12 (oRPC API route) require server-side API routes via Nitro, which only TanStack Start provides.

### Phase 1: Plan Update (`c6bb610`)
- Added **Section 2.5 — Step 0** to `docs/implementation-plan.md` with 9 sub-tasks
- Updated dependency graph: Step 0 → Step 8 → Step 9 → Step 10 → Step 11
- Updated Steps 8, 9, 12 to reference Step 0 as dependency
- Updated Appendix A (PRD traceability), B (dependency graph), C (known issues)
- Total steps: 40 → 41

### Phase 2: Execution (`2247d7b`)
Migrated from `@tanstack/react-router` + plain Vite to `@tanstack/react-start` SPA mode:

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/client.tsx` | Created — `hydrateRoot(document, <StartClient />)` |
| `src/server.ts` | Created — `createServerEntry` with Nitro handler |
| `src/router.tsx` | Created — `getRouter()` factory + QueryClient context |
| `src/routes/__root.tsx` | Rewritten — full HTML document + `head()` with meta/OG/fonts |
| `vite.config.ts` | Updated — `tanstackStart({ spa: true })` + `nitro()` + `tsconfigPaths` |
| `package.json` | Updated — `@tanstack/react-start` + `nitro` to deps, removed `@rsbuild/core` |
| `index.html` | Deleted — replaced by `__root.tsx` `head()` |
| `src/main.tsx` | Deleted — Start manages entry points |
| `.gitignore` | Updated — added `.output/` |

### Research Findings
- TanStack Query + Table are framework-agnostic (no migration benefit from Start)
- Start adds: server functions, API routes, SSR, Nitro runtime
- SPA mode (`spa: { enabled: true }`) gives server runtime WITHOUT SSR
- oRPC makes `createServerFn` redundant (both provide type-safe RPC)
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` works with Start (despite docs showing non-SWC)

### Verification
- `pnpm install` ✅
- `vite dev` → localhost:3000 ✅
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅

### Decisions
- See ADR-007 in decisions.md

## Session 14 — 2026-04-26: Finalisasi SPA Auth & PR ke `dev`

**Branch:** `feat/auth`
**PR:** https://github.com/alarwasyi98/edara/pull/9 (`feat/auth` → `dev`)

### What Happened
Blank page on dev server fixed. Three root causes found and resolved:
1. **Schema duplication in `users.ts`** — `userId` field defined twice, `userIdx` index defined twice, `t.userId` appeared twice in unique index → TypeScript error TS1117 blocked build entirely
2. **Better Auth `baseURL` invalid** — `auth-client.ts` used relative path `'/api/auth'` instead of absolute URL → runtime crash before React rendered
3. **Server deps leaked to client bundle** — `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` imported `auth` → `db` → `neon()` → TanStack Router bundled server-side code into client

### Fixes Applied
- Removed duplicate properties in `src/server/db/schema/users.ts`
- Changed `baseURL` to `window.location.origin` in `src/lib/auth-client.ts`
- Deleted `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` (SSR-only pattern incompatible with SPA)
- Updated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` to remove `/api/auth/$` references
- Added try/catch + error check in `getSession()` for graceful `null` return
- Added `.playwright-mcp/` to `.gitignore`

### Decisions
- Removed API auth route entirely (SSR-only, not SPA-compatible)
- `window.location.origin` as baseURL (safe in SPA, per Better Auth docs)
- `getSession()` returns `null` on error (route guard handles redirect)
- Created backup branch `feat/auth-backup-2026-04-26`

### Verification
All CI checks passed: format ✅, typecheck ✅, lint ✅ (8 warnings baseline), build ✅, tests ✅ (11 tests, 2 files). `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` render correctly. Route guard redirects work.

### Better Auth Audit (~40% complete)
- ✅ Auth schema correct (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`)
- ✅ Separation of concerns: Better Auth = identity, `user_school_assignments` = tenancy/RBAC
- ✅ Client layer clean and testable
- ✅ oRPC middleware scaffolding correct pattern
- ❌ No server runtime executing `betterAuth()` instance
- ❌ `src/lib/auth.ts` accessible from client (should be `src/server/`)
- ❌ `userSchoolAssignments.userId` missing FK to `user.id`
- ❌ Auth schema missing explicit `hashedPassword` column
- ❌ Admin router missing role checks
- ❌ Drizzle migration drift: snapshot has `user_id`, SQL `0000` still has `clerk_user_id`

## Session 13 — 2026-04-25: Better Auth Recovery on `feat/auth`

### What Happened
Recovery of Better Auth migration on `feat/auth` branch. White screen resolved, auth routes made consistent, CI checks passing, preview production bundle accessible.

### Key Fixes
- Removed duplicate `src/routes/auth/*` routes (kept canonical `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/forgot-password`)
- Regenerated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` after route cleanup
- Added route guards: `/_authenticated` redirects to `/sign-in?redirect=...`; public auth pages redirect logged-in users to `/`
- Replaced mock auth (Zustand/cookie) with Better Auth client calls in sign-in/sign-up forms
- Removed `createServerFn` dependency (not compatible with Vite SPA)
- Removed `tanstackStartCookies()` plugin (leaked `@tanstack/start-server-core` to client build)
- Added `.worktrees` ignore for ESLint, Prettier, `.gitignore`
- Generated forward migration `drizzle/0002_next_power_pack.sql` for Better Auth tables

### Root Causes
1. Two auth route systems coexisted (root `(auth)` + new `src/routes/auth/*`)
2. API/import patterns assumed full TanStack Start runtime (not SPA)
3. Local worktree polluted lint results
4. Previous "fix" commits contained mismatched APIs

---

## Session 12 — 2026-04-24: Better Auth Migration Fixes

### What Happened
Build errors from Better Auth migration implementation fixed. 12 of 13 migration tasks completed successfully. Remaining build errors resolved.

### Fixes
- Installed `@tanstack/react-start` package
- Moved `generateId` to `advanced.database.generateId`
- Changed `.inputValidator()` to `.input(z.object(...))`
- Regenerated routeTree for new auth routes
- Added missing `createFileRoute` import
- Fixed TypeScript `any` types with proper Zod schemas

### Migration Tasks Completed (12/13)
Package deps, schema naming (`clerkUserId` → `userId`), Better Auth schema, auth config, auth handler route, session helpers, oRPC middleware, assignment helper, auth pages, Clerk route removal, admin user router, documentation update.
